주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/06/debug-difficult-conversations/
설명 : 
                         Any time we talk to someone or to a group when there are high stakes and/or high emotions, difficult conversations can happen. If we ignore difficult conversations they typically don’t resolve themselves, in fact, they often get worse. Handling difficult conversations involves thinking about the logistics, having the proper mindset, and preparing yourselves.

Supporting software engineers to empower them means trusting them and getting out of their way.
