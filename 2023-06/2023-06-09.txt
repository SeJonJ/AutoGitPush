                            What Carbon Neutral Really Means and How Net-Zero Is Different
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/06/carbon-neutral-net-zero/
설명 : 
                         Carbon neutrality means that the total amount of emissions is either eliminated, neutralized, or compensated. Net-zero is a target that doesn’t include compensation and puts more emphasis on avoiding carbon emissions. Many products, data centers, or companies are already carbon neutral, but few have reached net-zero. The problem with offsetting approaches is that you continue to emit carbon.
