                            Embracing Complexity by Asking Questions, Listening, and Building a Shared Understanding
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/06/embracing-complexity/
설명 : 
                         When dealing with an environment that feels complex, people commonly look for ways to reduce variability and increase control for dealing with complexity. An alternative approach is to embrace complexity by acknowledging that it exists, asking questions and listening, and constructing a shared understanding based on different perspectives. This lets us improve how we adapt on an ongoing basis.

                            What Carbon Neutral Really Means and How Net-Zero Is Different
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/06/carbon-neutral-net-zero/
설명 : 
                         Carbon neutrality means that the total amount of emissions is either eliminated, neutralized, or compensated. Net-zero is a target that doesn’t include compensation and puts more emphasis on avoiding carbon emissions. Many products, data centers, or companies are already carbon neutral, but few have reached net-zero. The problem with offsetting approaches is that you continue to emit carbon.
