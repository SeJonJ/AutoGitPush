                            How to Prevent and Repay Technical Debt: What Teams, Tech Leads and Managers Can Do
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/02/prevent-repay-technical-debt/
설명 : 
                         Tech leads, project managers, and managers can prevent technical debt by giving software developers more time; in addition, they can plan for spare time and refactoring sprints to allow teams to improve code. To prioritise technical debt, development teams can show how much time we can save if we invest, and how complicated the software will become in the future if we don’t repay technical debt.
