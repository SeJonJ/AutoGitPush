                            Testing across a Large Number of Inputs with Property-Based Testing
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/07/property-based-testing/
설명 : 
                         Property-based testing is an approach that involves specifying statements that should always be true, rather than relying on specific examples. It enables you to test functions across a large number of inputs with fewer tests. Every run of a property-based test will use different inputs, which can give you confidence your code works in a general case.
