                            Late Architecture with Functional Programming
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/04/late-arch-functional-programming/
설명 : 
                         Many approaches to software architecture assume that the architecture is planned at the beginning. Unfortunately, architecture planned in this way is hard to change later. Functional programming can help achieve loose coupling to the point that advance planning can be kept to a minimum, and architectural decisions can be changed later.
