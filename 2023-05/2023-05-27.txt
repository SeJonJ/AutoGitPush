주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/05/curiosity-self-aware-conflict/
설명 : 
                         When you're in a team, collaborating with others, it's crucial to embrace diverse opinions and dissent;  you need to have good conflicts. Conflicts have bad reputations, but with curiosity you can harvest more positive outcomes and build trust and psychological safety. Self-awareness of your emotions and reactions can help prevent saying or doing something that you might regret later.
