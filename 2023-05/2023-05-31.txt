                            Unlocking Software Engineering Potential for Better Products
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/05/software-engineering-potential/
설명 : 
                         Becoming an empowered team means solving problems rather than shipping features. Empowering software engineers and involving them early in discovery work can result in better products. If we measure outcomes rather than output, we can also hold teams accountable. Supporting software engineers to empower them means trusting them and getting out of their way.
