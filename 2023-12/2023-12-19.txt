                            Quarkus 3.7 Will Require Java 17
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/12/quarkus-3-7-java-17/
설명 : 
                         Quarkus 3.7, planned for release in January 2024, will require Java 17 as the minimal JDK version to build and run applications. One of the reasons is the fact that the OpenJDK community stopped active support for Java 11 in September 2023. Next to that, Quarkus dependencies are also upgrading their baseline to Java 17.
