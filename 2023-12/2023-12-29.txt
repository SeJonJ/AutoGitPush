                            Upsides and Downsides of Open Source Adoption
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/12/upsides-downsides-open-source/
설명 : 
                         Benefits of open source projects are supporting rapid innovation, the flexibility provided to customize and adapt tools, and transparency of the code which can enhance security efforts. The downsides are that security by obscurity doesn’t apply, open source is potentially prone to abuse, and when open source tools are not backed up by companies, it might result in a lower level of maintainability.
