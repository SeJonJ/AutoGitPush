                            Why Leading without Blame Matters to Leaders and Teams
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/12/leading-without-blame/
설명 : 
                         According to Diana Larsen, a culture of blame is a waste of human potential. People cannot achieve their best and most creative work when their energy goes into avoiding shame and blame. To lead without blame requires a shift toward learning and curiosity, she argues. It begins by building or restoring a relationship of trust and trustworthiness with the people.
