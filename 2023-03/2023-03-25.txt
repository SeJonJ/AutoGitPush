설명 : 
                         A recent survey on supply chain security practices found that some practices are widely adopted but key practices are lagging behind. Key practices, such as generating provenance, were noted for lagging behind in adoption. The survey also found that the perceived usefulness of a practice is highly correlated with the adoption of that practice.
