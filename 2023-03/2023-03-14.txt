주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/03/quarkus-3-DX/
설명 : 
                         Our previous conversation with the Quarkus team focused on the technical changes to deliver on their mission. More than speed and cloud nativeness, Developer Experience (DX) and the focus on productivity were also an important part of each of the previous major releases. To find out whether version 3.0 will follow this tradition, InfoQ continued the conversation with Andersen.
