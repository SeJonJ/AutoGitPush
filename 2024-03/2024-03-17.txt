                            How Continuous Discovery Helps Software Teams to Take Product Decisions
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/continuous-discovery-software/
설명 : 
                         Continuous discovery for product development is regular research that involves the entire software product team, and that can actively inform product decisions. Equating continuous discovery to weekly conversations with one or more customers can be misleading. Combining quantitative and qualitative research methods can help software teams gather data and understand what is behind the data.
