주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/11/equalsverifier-jpa-entities/
설명 : 
                         The EqualsVerifier library may be used in Java unit tests to automatically verify equals() implementations inside a project and provides one hundred percent code coverage on equals() and hashCode() methods. Recent releases improved support for JPA, by requiring the use of getters instead of using fields, and solving several related bugs.
