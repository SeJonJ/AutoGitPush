                            Leading in Hybrid and Remote Environments: Skills to Develop and Tools That Can Help
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/04/leading-hybrid-skills-tools/
설명 : 
                         Leading in hybrid and remote environments requires that managers develop new skills like coaching, facilitation, and being able to do difficult conversations remotely. With digital tools, we can include less dominant and more reflective people to get wider reflections from different brains and personalities. This can result in more diverse and inclusive working environments.
