제목: What is the main difference between MySQL and MariaDB?

MySQL and MariaDB are both relational database management systems (RDBMS) that provide a wide range of features for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The primary difference between them lies in their development and maintenance.

MySQL was originally developed by Swedish company MySQL AB and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is now maintained and updated by Oracle as part of the Oracle Database product line. MariaDB, on the other hand, was forked from MySQL in 2009 by Michael Widenius, one of the co-founders of MySQL. The main goal of MariaDB was to maintain the spirit of open source collaboration and innovation that had been present in MySQL's early years but which was perceived as being lost after Oracle's acquisition.

In terms of functionality, both databases are very similar, with MariaDB generally aiming to be binary compatible with MySQL. However, there are some differences:

1. Licensing: MariaDB is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), while MySQL is available under both GPL and a commercial license. This means that MariaDB is more suitable for open source projects or organizations that prefer to use only free software.
2. Performance: There are reports of MariaDB being faster than MySQL in certain scenarios, but the difference is generally negligible for most applications. Both databases have similar performance characteristics overall.
3. Features: MariaDB has introduced some new features not present in MySQL, such as Spatial Extensions (for geospatial data), Wiki-style transactional table replication, and a built-in document store. However, these features are often available as third-party plugins for MySQL as well.
4. Compatibility: MariaDB aims to be fully compatible with MySQL, but there may still be some differences in behavior or compatibility with certain MySQL extensions.
5. Community and Development: MariaDB has a strong focus on community involvement and open source development, while Oracle's ownership of MySQL has led some users to perceive it as being more corporate and less responsive to the community's needs.

In summary, the main difference between MySQL and MariaDB is their development and maintenance history, with MariaDB being a fork from MySQL that aims to maintain its open source spirit and innovation while offering similar functionality and performance.

제목: JEP 384, which was released in Java 11, introduced compact object headers to improve the performance of the `Object.getClass()` method by reducing the overhead of accessing class metadata. This improvement was achieved by adding a new header to each object that contains the class pointer and other relevant information.

However, this change had an impact on the compatibility of existing code with older versions of Java. To address this issue, JEP 519 was introduced in Java 25 (Java 17) to provide a way for applications to opt-in to using compact object headers even when running on older versions of Java.

By enabling this feature, applications can take advantage of the performance improvements brought by compact object headers while still being able to run on older JVMs that do not support them. This is achieved by including a special flag in the class file, indicating that the class uses compact object headers.

To enable this feature, you need to set the `-XX:+UseCompactStrings` flag when running your application. This flag instructs the JVM to use compact object headers for string objects as well, which can further improve performance in certain scenarios.

Note that enabling this feature may not be compatible with all existing codebases, so it is recommended to thoroughly test your application before deploying it in a production environment.
주소: https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/06/java-25-compact-object-headers/
설명: Java 25는 Compact Object Headers(JEP 519)를 소개합니다. 이것은 작은 객체를 가진 애플리케이션에서 CPU 사용량을 최대 30% 감소시키고 메모리 사용량을 줄여줍니다. 이 사용자 친화적인 기능은 객체 헤더를 8바이트로 압축하며, JVM 플래그만 활성화하면 됩니다. Amazon에 의해 광범위하게 검증되어 성능을 향상시키고 GC 压力를 줄이며, 현대적인 클라우드 배포에 최적화된 기능입니다.

With this update, you can easily create, review, and merge pull requests directly from the command line, without having to switch between different tools or interfaces.

To get started with triangular workflows using GitHub CLI, you need to have the tool installed on your machine. You can install it by following the instructions on the official GitHub CLI website. Once installed, you can use the following commands to create a new pull request:

```
gh pr create -b feature/my-new-feature -L 42,45 -R "Add support for triangular workflows"
```

This command creates a new pull request with the title "Add support for triangular workflows", based on the branch `feature/my-new-feature`. The `-L 42,45` option specifies that lines 42 and 45 in the file should be changed. You can also use the `-A` option to specify the author of the pull request, or the `-R` option to set the reviewers for the pull request.

Once you have created a pull request, you can use the following commands to manage it:

```
gh pr view
gh pr checkout <pr number>
gh pr merge <pr number>
```

The `gh pr view` command displays information about the pull request, including its status and any comments or reviews. The `gh pr checkout` command checks out the branch associated with the pull request, so you can make changes directly in your local environment.

As their platform grew in popularity, so did the need for comprehensive and up-to-date documentation. To address this challenge, Pinterest's engineering team decided to adopt Docs-as-Code.

The first step was to choose a tool that would support their new approach. They selected GitHub Pages, which allowed them to host their documentation on the same platform as their code repository. This integration made it easier for developers to contribute to both the code and documentation simultaneously.

Next, they established a clear structure for their documentation. They organized it into modules based on product areas, such as API, frontend, and backend. Each module had its own directory in the GitHub repository, making it easy to find and update specific sections.

To ensure consistency across the documentation, Pinterest implemented a set of guidelines and best practices. These included formatting conventions, writing style, and examples for each product area. They also created templates for common documentation types, such as API references and user guides, which made it easier for contributors to follow the same format.

With Docs-as-Code in place, Pinterest's engineering team could now collaborate on documentation more efficiently. Developers could make changes directly in the GitHub repository, and their changes would be automatically built and published using a continuous integration (CI) system. This process ensured that the documentation was always up-to-date with the latest code changes.

The benefits of Docs-as-Code were immediately apparent. The quality of Pinterest's documentation improved significantly, as developers could now easily contribute to it without disrupting the workflow. Additionally, the automation provided by the CI system ensured that the documentation was always in sync with the codebase.

In conclusion, adopting Docs-as-Code has helped Pinterest improve the quality of their documentation, making it more accessible and up-to-date for both internal teams and external users. By treating documentation as code, they were able to streamline collaboration, maintain consistency, and ensure that their documentation remained an accurate reflection of their ever-evolving platform.
