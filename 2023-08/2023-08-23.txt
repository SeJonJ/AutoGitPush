                            A Ruthless Approach for Better Security by Identifying Key Risks and Ignoring Others
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/08/better-security-key-risks/

                         Risk management techniques can be used to decide which security and privacy aspects are important. You can simplify the risk impact calculations by identifying low, medium and high and critical losses, and by taking likelihoods from the industry to do likelihood calculations. This helps you to identify a few key risks, and ruthlessly ignore the rest.
