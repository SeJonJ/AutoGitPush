                            Why Stable Software Teams Aren't Always Best: Self-Selection Reteaming at Redgate
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/01/self-selection-reteaming/
설명 : 
                         There are advantages to having the same group of people stay together, especially in achieving a time-bound software development project. However, in a world where we increasingly see product or stream-aligned teams who own long-living software from creation through to delivery, operation, and ongoing improvements, then optimising for very stable teams is not the best idea, Chris Smith argues.
