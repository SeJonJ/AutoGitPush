                            Slack Migrates to Cell-Based Architecture on AWS to Mitigate Gray Failures
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/01/slack-cell-based-architecture/
설명 : 
                         Slack migrated most of the critical user-facing services from a monolithic to a cell-based architecture over the last 1.5 years. The move was triggered by the impact of networking outages affecting a single availability zone, causing user-impacting service degradation. The new architecture allows incrementally draining all the traffic away from the affected availability zone within 5 minutes.
