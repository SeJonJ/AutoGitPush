주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/09/graalvm-java-21/
설명 : 
                         Oracle has recently announced the release of GraalVM for JDK 21. GraalVM is a JDK that uses an alternative just-in-time (JIT) compiler but it also includes a Native Image module, a technology that allows Java applications to run as native executables, without the need for a JVM. This can improve the performance of Java applications in terms of speed, memory, and size.
