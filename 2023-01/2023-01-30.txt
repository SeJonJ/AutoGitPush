                            Mockito 5 Supports Mocking Constructors, Static Methods and Final Classes Out of the Box
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/01/mockito-5/
설명 : 
                         Mockito has released version 5, switching the default mockmaker to mockito-inline in order to better support future versions of the JDK and allows mocking of constructors, static methods and final classes out of the box. The baseline increased from Java 8 to Java 11, as supporting both versions became costly and managing changes in the JDK such as with the SecurityManager proved difficult.

                            How Lyft Detects Android Memory Leaks in Production
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/01/lyft-android-memory-leaks/
설명 : 
                         While modern tooling for Android and iOS enable memory leak detection using local builds, this is not enough to guarantee an app shows correct memory behavior in production, where it runs on a wide range of devices in diverse conditions. For this reason, Lyft engineers combine A/B testing and memory observability to detect which features leak memory.
