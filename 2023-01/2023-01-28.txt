                            How Lyft Detects Android Memory Leaks in Production
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/01/lyft-android-memory-leaks/
설명 : 
                         While modern tooling for Android and iOS enable memory leak detection using local builds, this is not enough to guarantee an app shows correct memory behavior in production, where it runs on a wide range of devices in diverse conditions. For this reason, Lyft engineers combine A/B testing and memory observability to detect which features leak memory.
