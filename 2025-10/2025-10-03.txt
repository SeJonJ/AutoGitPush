제목: Microsoft is testing a new cooling technology called microfluidic cooling, which could potentially be used in next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The company has filed a patent for the technology, which involves using fluids to transfer heat away from the chip and into a cooling system. This could help prevent overheating and improve the performance of AI chips.

The patent describes a microfluidic cooling system that uses channels filled with fluid to transport heat away from the chip. The fluid is circulated through the channels using a pump, and the heat is transferred to a cooling system outside the chip. This process can be repeated multiple times to further dissipate the heat.

Microfluidic cooling has been used in other applications before, such as cooling electronic devices and medical equipment. However, Microsoft's patent suggests that this technology could be particularly useful for AI chips, which generate a lot of heat due to their high processing power.

Overheating can be a major issue for AI chips, as it can cause them to slow down or even shut down. This can limit the performance and efficiency of AI systems, which rely on these chips to process large amounts of data quickly. By using microfluidic cooling, Microsoft hopes to overcome this problem and improve the capabilities of its AI technology.

The patent was filed by Microsoft's research division, which is known for developing innovative technologies that can be used in a variety of applications. If successful, microfluidic cooling could become a key component in future generations of AI chips, helping to power everything from self-driving cars to advanced robotics.

제목: VS Code MSSQL Extension v1.35 has been released, bringing several new features to General Availability (GA). The extension now includes Schema Compare, Designer, and Local Containers. 

Schema Compare allows you to compare the schema of two SQL Server databases and generate a script to synchronize them. This can be useful for keeping development, testing, and production environments in sync or for migrating data between different databases.

The Designer feature provides a visual interface for designing and modifying database objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and functions. It offers drag-and-drop functionality and real-time validation of SQL syntax, making it easier to create and manage database structures.

Local Containers enable you to run SQL Server in a Docker container on your local machine without the need for an Azure subscription or any cloud infrastructure. This feature simplifies development and testing by providing a self-contained environment for running SQL Server locally.

To use these new features, make sure you have updated the VS Code MSSQL Extension to version 1.35. You can find more information about the extension and its features on the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mssql/vscode-mssql](https://github.com/mssql/vscode-mssql).

제목: The OWASP Flags tool is a powerful and widely-used tool in the field of web application security testing. However, like any other tool, it can be misused if not used properly. One potential critical threat that could arise from the misuse of the OWASP Flags tool is Agentic AI.

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence that is capable of acting on its own accord and making decisions independently. If an attacker gains access to the OWASP Flags tool and uses it to launch attacks, they could potentially use Agentic AI to carry out these attacks without human intervention. This would make it much more difficult for security teams to detect and respond to the attacks in a timely manner.

To mitigate this threat, organizations should ensure that access to the OWASP Flags tool is restricted to authorized personnel only, and that proper security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, regular training and awareness programs should be conducted to educate employees on the proper use of the tool and the potential risks associated with its misuse. By taking these steps, organizations can help ensure that the OWASP Flags tool is used safely and effectively, and that Agentic AI threats are minimized.

제목: Instagram has introduced a new ranking framework that aims to reduce notification fatigue and improve engagement on the platform. The update will prioritize notifications for content that is most relevant to users, ensuring that they receive alerts for posts that are likely to be of interest to them. This change is expected to increase user satisfaction and encourage more frequent use of the app.

The new ranking system takes into account various factors such as the user's interaction history with the account, the recency of the post, and the engagement level of the content. By prioritizing notifications for posts that are most relevant to users, Instagram hopes to reduce the number of irrelevant or less engaging notifications that users receive.

This update is part of Instagram's ongoing efforts to improve user experience on the platform. In recent years, the app has introduced several features aimed at reducing the amount of time users spend on the app, including the introduction of a "You're All Caught Up" message when users have seen all new posts in their feed, and the removal of likes in Australia as part of a test to reduce pressure on users.

The new ranking framework is expected to be rolled out to all users in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen how this update will impact engagement levels on the platform, but it is likely that users will appreciate receiving fewer notifications for content that is less relevant to them.

제목: What is the difference between .NET MAUI and Xamarin.Forms?

.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a new framework that was introduced by Microsoft in 2021 as a successor to Xamarin.Forms. The main difference between the two frameworks is that .NET MAUI is built on top of .NET 5 and provides better performance, while Xamarin.Forms is built on top of Xamarin and provides more platform-specific features.

In terms of functionality, both frameworks allow developers to create native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows using a single codebase. However, .NET MAUI offers some improvements over Xamarin.Forms, such as better performance, improved tooling, and support for more modern UI patterns like MVVM.

Additionally, .NET MAUI provides experimental support for Android CoreCLR, which allows developers to run .NET code directly on the Android platform without relying on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This can lead to better performance and easier development of cross-platform apps.

Overall, .NET MAUI is a more modern framework that offers improved performance and tooling over Xamarin.Forms, while still providing the ability to create native mobile apps for multiple platforms using a single codebase.
